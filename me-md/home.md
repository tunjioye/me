# Hi! I'm Tunji Oyeniran

I am a <mark class="highlight">Fullstack Developer</mark> who loves building useful mobile friendly applications using Laravel, PHP, React, Vue and Node JS.

Sometimes I love to dabble in Graphics Design using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, XD and Figma.

Either way, I am always interested in problem solving, web development, tutoring, playing strategy games and getting amazed by artificial intelligence.
